[00:45.52] I got an uncontrollable urge /
[00:50.17] Another day brings another purge /
[00:55.26] I roam the streets to find a trace /
[01:00.64] To find a reason and solace
[01:14.14] 
[01:05.87] I got a feeling inside of me /
[01:11.21] It 's a kind of strange melancholy /
[01:16.26] Don't feel complete, something is wrong/
[01:21.68] I need a place where I belong
[01:36.18] 
[01:26.66] But every night I hear her call /
[01:31.85] A whisper first and then a howl /
[01:37.23] I disappear into the night so black
[01:41.84] I'm back on track - back with her pack
[02:00.84] 
[01:53.00] Together we will rule the night
[01:57.88] All teamed up ready to fight
[02:03.14] From dusk till dawn we run as one
[02:08.29] Our hunting season has begun
[02:22.29] 
[02:13.73] I got a feeling inside of me /
[02:18.78] It 's a kind of strange melancholy /
[02:23.92] Now I feel whole and I feel strong/
[02:29.36] I found a place where I belong
[02:44.36] 
[02:34.55] And every night I hear her call /
[02:40.06] A whisper first and then a howl /
[02:45.12] I disappear into the night so black
[02:49.75] I'm back on track - back with her pack
[03:08.75] 
[03:00.63] From dusk till dawn we run as one
[03:17.13] 
[03:18.82] I got a feeling inside of me /
[03:24.64] It 's a kind of strange melancholy /
[03:29.40] Now I feel whole and I feel strong/
[03:34.70] I found a place where I belong
[03:39.91] And every night I hear her call /
[03:45.42] A whisper first and then a howl /
[03:50.83] I disappear into the night so black
[03:55.29] I'm back on track - back with her pack
[04:14.29] 
[04:01.48] I disappear into the night so black
[04:05.67] I'm back on track - back with her pack
